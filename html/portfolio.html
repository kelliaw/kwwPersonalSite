            <h3>Curriculum Designer (2020)</h3>
            <p>
                Hired by Jefferson County Public Schools, this curriculum was targeted for middle school grades (6-8) to
                bridge
                and spread cultural and racial awareness for students.
                <br><br>Kentucky state standards and Social Justice standards were utilized to create and build lesson
                objectives
                and assessments.
                <br><br>Project time was one month (40 hours per week for three weeks) to design a ten-lesson
                curriculum. This is
                designed to be implemented over six weeks.
                <br><br>I used different forms of digital media to make the content engaging for diverse learners. The
                formatting of
                the curriculum is flexible and can be modified in its entirety for virtual or in-person options.
                <br><br>Throughout the design process, I collaborated with fellow colleagues for design feedback and
                input.
            </p>

            <h3>Professional Development (2021)</h3>
            <p>
                Led a professional development at the Jefferson County Public School's Deeper Learning Symposium to a
                group of
                45 educators. The professional development introduced teaching strategies, practices, and curriculum
                that could
                be utilized inside of the classroom, with racial equity at the forefront. Said curriculum centers around
                building relationships through reflection, story sharing, and empathy as a radical action.

            <p>
                This was a mock-up designed for Eduflow to train new hires on giving effective product
                demonstrations.
                This is
                one example of how I could potentially educate and acclimate those new to a specific organization.
                <br><br>"When you land a new junior sales rep, they might not always have the necessary skills to
                feel
                solid on
                their own. We have built a course template specifically for that: training materials to help your
                reps
                become
                stronger.
                <br><br>In this course template, there are different flows & activities that help train junior sales
                reps with
                giving effective online product demonstration. Simply edit the content of this course to reflect
                your
                company
                and start engaging your new hires!"

            <h3>Curriculum Design (2020-2021)</h3>
            <p>
                This was a website designed to organize and collect all resources and media for the virtual
                2020-2021
                school
                year. This curriculum is targeted for 6th grade learners to strengthen language arts and math skills
                (due to
                interrupted learning from COVID), spread awareness of digital literacy, focus on how to best utilize
                digital
                tools during virtual learning, how to protect your identity while using social media and digital
                platforms, and
                leadership skills.
                <br><br>All instruction and assessments were based on the Kentucky State Standards. Multiple forms
                of
                progress data
                from assessments were analyzed to determine the specific course of learning experiences.
                <br><br>At the most recent update, this project has lasted for over 25 weeks, implemented five days
                per
                week, five
                classes per day. Each class has 25-30 students with varying levels of proficiency. I use multiple
                forms
                of
                digital media to make the content engaging and appealing for 10-12 year olds. The formatting of the
                curriculum
                is flexible and can be modified in its entirety for virtual or in-person options.
                <br><br>Throughout the on-going design process, I collaborated with three different committees to
                review
                assessment
                data and make curriculum adjustments.

            <h3>(2016-2020)</h3>
            <p>
                These are a sampling of literature reviews, assessment analysis, and coaching sessions since
                2018,
                researched
                and written for my post-baccalaureate work.
                <br><br>Subjects surround technology, digital literacy, and ways that digital tools can be used
                to
                enhance digital
                literacy and learning experiences. Initially, the focus was specifically on ways that
                technological
                advances can
                best support English learners, but I quickly realized that these practices can support anyone.
                <br><br>I enjoy writing and researching about topics related to curriculum design and
                instruction, and
                these
                findings have enhanced my overall practices. It has also enabled me to better teach and help my
                colleagues and
                their curriculum design.
                <br><br>Other examples of writing show the analytics behind curriculum assessments and
                collaborative/coaching
                experiences with a colleague in my school.
